C_g is camera's position within global coordinate system
C_v is camera's position within vehicle coordinate system (local)
T_g is camera's focus point (aka target) within the global coordinate system

generally _v prefix means the vector or point's value must be taken within the vehicle's coordinate system. 
    that means if u try to debug-print this point it'll usually appear around the origin of the map, which may be underground or far-away.
    u typically wanna apply ur FX here.

_g prefix means the vector/point is taken wrt the global coordinate system. 
    that means if u rotate the car, this one's value will change. 
    you generally do NOT want to edit _g variables or apply FX on them unless u know what ur doing.

_V means that the variable can be changed, i.e it isn't a constant derived from the car 
    (e.g `ref` is the car's refnode. we, effect makers, can't change this)
    but we can change the camera's base/offset variable as that doesn't depend on the car, map, or constant.

    thus _V can be seen as "this is part of the camera's public API, change this to apply any effect you want."

everything from `data` i.e from update(data) is global in coordinate frame.
