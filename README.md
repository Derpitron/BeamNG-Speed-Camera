[WIP] A dynamic, physics based camera mod for BeamNG.Drive built to visually convey a violent sense of speed and vehicle forces to the player.

As part of the work a lightweight, real-time, extensible and modifiable signal processing FX creation infrastructure emerged. This framework provides a minimal, functionally complete collection of relevant physics simulation signals and keeps them decoupled from FX design, letting designers draft and iterate on FX easily.

If you can't understand how to use this mod/framework after looking through it for 10 minutes i consider that a bug. post any of your questions on the BeamNG forum thread for this (when it exists) and I'll try my best to answer or improve the mod so it's easier for people to pick up and create with.
