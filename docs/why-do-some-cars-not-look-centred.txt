# for mod developers/patchers:

some third party vehicles have not set their:

offset
orbitOffset
chaseOffset
default
minDistance 

variables for their cameras properly.
this is why chase.lua, orbit.lua, and my camera don't look centred on those vehicles. this is not a problem of my or beamng's camera code and
adding individual fixes for each modded vehicle is out of scope for this mod.

the fix: you can check your vehicle's centre x-position in blender, and add that as the offset in your vehicle jbeam. exactly how to do this i don't remember,
it's been quite a while since i last edited vehicle jbeam. you should check vehicle's origin, refnode position, centre-visual position, etc

# for my mod and other people's vehicle mod users:

you should kindly ask mod authors to fix their vehicle's camera offsets in their jbeam, or, better yet, fix it for them and send them the patch so they can
add it in. help others help you.
